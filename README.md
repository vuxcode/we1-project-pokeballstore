# Project Instructions
# Project Plan — Reusable Event Registration Website

## 1. Project Idea
The goal of this project is to create a reusable website where different types of activities can be presented and people can sign up to participate.

The website will not be built for a specific event.  
Instead, it will act as a template where only the event information needs to be changed.

Possible uses:
- Competitions
- Challenges
- Group activities
- Meetings
- Contests

---

## 2. Purpose
The website should allow an organizer to:

- Present an event
- Provide important information
- Explain rules or requirements
- Allow participants to register
- Show a participant list

The main focus is a clear and logical HTML structure that is easy to understand and reuse.

## 3. Pages Overview

### Home Page — `index.html`
Gives a quick overview of the event.

Content:
- Event title
- Short introduction
- Date and location
- Organizer information
- Navigation links to other pages

---

### Event Details — `details.html`
Provides deeper information about the activity.

Content:
- Full description
- Rules
- Requirements
- Schedule

---

### Signup Page — `signup.html`
Allows a user to register for the event.

Form fields:
- Name
- Contact information
- Optional comment
- Submit button

---

### Participants Page — `participants.html`
Displays participants.

Content:
- List of participants
- Optional waiting list

---

## 4. Reusability Plan
The website layout should never need to be changed.

Only the text content inside sections will be edited:

- Event name
- Description
- Date
- Location
- Rules

This makes the webpage reusable for many different activities without rewriting the code.

---

## 5. Technical Plan
The project will focus on simple and clear HTML.

Planned structure:
- Headings for hierarchy
- Paragraphs for text
- Div elements for grouping content
- Links for navigation between pages
- A basic form for registration

No advanced functionality is required.  
If dynamic features are added in the future, they will be part of a separate project.

- Easy to modify content
- Consistent layout between pages
